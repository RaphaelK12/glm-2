# *OpenGL Mathematics for C*

[*glm-c*](https://github.com/sizeof-voidp/glm-c) is a C alternative of the C++ library [*glm*](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).
It was made referencing the [*GLSL specification*](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.pdf) as well. This is meant to be used in C11/C17, you could use this no problem in C99/C89 with a smaller feature set though.

### Macros for generating typenames
In *glm-c* you have a few macros which are meant for use as template replacement, they are used to generate typenames.
The common ones are `glm_scalar(T, Q)`, `glm_vec(L, T, Q)` and `glm_mat(C, R, T, Q)`. 
As an example `glm_vec(3, float, defaultp)` would become `glm_vec3` after the preprocessing step.

```c

glm_mat(4, 4, float, highp) m = ...;
glm_vec(4, float, highp) v = ...;

v = glm_mulv_mat4x4_highp(m, v);

```

### Macros for constructing types
Macros for constructing types, these are unique not only to each type, such as `glm_vec4()` and `glm_uint2()`, but they also are defined for each qualifier variant. Except `defaultp` as that can be ignored. These work exactly as *GLSL* constructors but there is both a compile time cost, and run-time cost as it uses C11's `_Generic()` and variadic functions to parse through arguments.

```c
{
	// Construct default precision vector of 3 unsigned integers
	glm_uint3 co = glm_uint3(25, 22, 10);

	// You can construct a vector, from another of the same length
	// Effectively all this does is a cast
	// You can either manually type out the constructor macro's name, or use the
	// template like macro for generating the typename.
	// All function-like macros which construct types, have the same name
	// as those types.
	glm_uint3_lowp cp = glm_vec(3, uint, lowp)(co);
}

{
	// You can mix and match types, and lengths, just like in GLSL

	glm_uint2 v1 = ...;
	glm_bool2 v2 = ...;

	glm_vec4 v = glm_vec4();
}
```
